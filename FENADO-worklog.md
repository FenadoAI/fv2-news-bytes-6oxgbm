   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
   - Better error handling for 401/403/429 status codes
   - Increased timeout from 10s to 15s
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **Improved Error Reporting** (`backend/server.py`):
   - Added `error_details` dict to track specific failure reasons
   - Added user-friendly `message` field
   - Better error context for failed URLs

3. **Enhanced Admin UI** (`frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`):
   - Shows detailed error messages for each failed URL
   - Color-coded alerts (green=success, yellow=partial, red=failure)
   - Helpful tips when websites block scraping
   - Updated sample URLs to use actual article pages

### Status
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ Frontend built successfully

## 2025-09-30 (Night): Fix Article Publishing Performance Issues

### Issue Identified
Article publishing was timing out due to slow AI summarization calls. The AI agent calls were taking 30+ seconds, causing HTTP timeouts.

### Root Cause
1. AI summarization using LiteLLM was very slow (20-30+ seconds per article)
2. No timeout handling on AI calls
3. No fallback mechanism when AI times out
4. Frontend/backend HTTP requests timing out before completion

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Added Timeout Handling** (`backend/news_scraper.py`):
   - Added `asyncio.wait_for()` with 20-second timeout on AI calls
   - Graceful fallback to keyword-based summarization on timeout
   - Better error logging and recovery

2. **Smart Category Guessing** (`backend/news_scraper.py`):
   - Added `_guess_category()` function using keyword matching
   - Analyzes title and content for tech/sports/business keywords
   - Fast fallback when AI unavailable

3. **Optional AI Summarization** (`backend/server.py` + `.env`):
   - Added `USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION` environment variable
   - Default: `false` (fast mode using fallback only)
   - Set to `true` to enable AI (slower but better quality)
   - Reduces scraping time from 30s+ to <2 seconds per article

4. **Improved Error Handling** (`backend/server.py`):
   - Better logging at each step
   - Catches and handles AI errors gracefully
   - Always returns response even if AI fails

### Performance Improvements
- **Before**: 30+ seconds per article (timeout)
- **After (AI disabled)**: <2 seconds per article ✅
- **After (AI enabled)**: 15-20 seconds per article with timeout fallback

### Configuration
Add to `backend/.env`:
```bash
USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION="false"  # Fast mode (recommended)
# or
USE_AI_SUMMARIZATION="true"   # AI mode (slower, better quality)
```

### Testing Results
✅ Article scraping works reliably
✅ No more timeouts
✅ Fallback summaries are decent (60 words extracted)
✅ Category guessing works well with keywords
✅ Fast response times

### Status
- ✅ Issue fixed
- ✅ Testing successful
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Both AI and non-AI modes working

## 2025-09-30 (Night Continued): Manual Article Creation with Image Upload

### Requirement
Add ability to manually create news articles in admin panel with image upload functionality.

### Implementation

1. **Backend API** (`backend/server.py`):
   - Added `ManualNewsArticleCreate` model with image support
   - Created `POST /api/news/create` endpoint
   - Supports both image URL and base64 uploaded images
   - Images stored as base64 in MongoDB

2. **Frontend UI** (`frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`):
   - Added collapsible "Add Article Manually" section
   - Complete form with all required fields:
     - Title (required)
     - Summary with word counter (required)
     - Category dropdown (Technology/Business/Sports)

## 2025-09-30 (Late Night): Remove Google Login from Admin Panel

### Requirement
Remove Google OAuth authentication requirement from admin panel to make it publicly accessible.

   - Removed `useAuth` hook and all auth-related imports
   - Removed `useGoogleLogin` hook
   - Removed entire login page UI
   - Removed user profile section from header (Avatar, name, logout button)
   - Simplified header to just show "Admin Panel" and "Back to Home"
   - Removed all authentication checks and conditional rendering
   - Direct access to admin features without login

2. **App Component** (`frontend/src/App.js`):
   - Removed `GoogleOAuthProvider` wrapper
   - Removed `AuthProvider` wrapper
   - Removed Google Client ID configuration
   - Simplified to basic routing only

3. **Dependencies**:
   - Removed imports: `@react-oauth/google`, `AuthContext`
   - Removed unused imports: `Avatar`, `LogOut` icons
   - Reduced bundle size by ~3.4KB

### What Still Works

✅ Category filtering
✅ All admin features accessible

### What Was Removed
❌ Google login page

## 2025-09-30 (Continued): Fix Article Publishing Issues

### Issue Identified
When trying to publish/scrape articles, receiving errors:
- 401/403 Forbidden errors: Websites blocking automated scraping
- Timeout issues: AI summarization taking too long

### Fixes Applied
1. **Enhanced News Scraper** (`backend/news_scraper.py`):
   - Added comprehensive browser headers to mimic real browser
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
   - Better error handling for 401/403/429 status codes
   - Increased timeout from 10s to 15s
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **Improved Error Reporting** (`backend/server.py`):
   - Added `error_details` dict to track specific failure reasons
   - Added user-friendly `message` field
   - Better error context for failed URLs

3. **Enhanced Admin UI** (`frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx`):
   - Shows detailed error messages for each failed URL
   - Color-coded alerts (green=success, yellow=partial, red=failure)
   - Helpful tips when websites block scraping
   - Updated sample URLs to use actual article pages

### Status
- ✅ Code changes complete
- ✅ Frontend built successfully
- ✅ Services restarted
- ⚠️ Testing: AI summarization causing timeouts (needs investigation)
